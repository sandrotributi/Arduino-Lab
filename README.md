### Candle Flame

### Ultrasonic Parking Sensor

We must constantly measure the distance from a possible obstacle and emit a sound that is all the 
more rapid and insistent the lower the measurement is.   
We will in fact consider three cases:
1. obstacle out of range: we will not make any sound;
2. obstacle too close: we will make a continuous sound;
3. obstacle at intermediate distance: the sounds are emitted with a frequency inversely proportional
   to the distance (closer, faster and higher).
   
Distances are expressed in centimeters.
